all scripts require environmental variables for `CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`. these are normal app things, and you can pull them from apps.twitter.com.

favbomb.js - goes through and faves some number of a user's tweets. requires `USER_HANDLE` (user's twitter handle) and `TWEET_COUNT` (number of tweets to fav).

repeatfav.js - repeatedly favorites a tweet. requires `REPEAT_COUNT` (number of times to fav/unfav) and `STATUS_ID` (the id of the tweet).
